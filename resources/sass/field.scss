// When the last element is a detail form is value toggled such that
// it is no longer visible, the second to last child (which is now
// the last child) still shows a bottom border. Let's fix that.

div[dusk*="detail"] .card > .border-b:last-child:not([class*="remove-bottom-border"]) {
    border-bottom: none;
